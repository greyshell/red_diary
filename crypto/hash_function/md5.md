# MD5

1. Collision resistance: has been broken and attacked.
2. Pre-image-resistance: In April 2009, an attack against MD5 was published that breaks MD5's preimage resistance. This attack is only `theoretical`, with a computational complexity of 2123.4 for full preimage.
3. 2nd pre-image resistance property does not impacted by any attack. 
4. Therefore, technically still it is safe to use in the context when we donâ€™t need its collision resistance and Pre-image-resistance property.
