Underperforming refers to a situation in which someone or something is not meeting expectations or performing at a lower level than anticipated.

I experienced an interesting scenario in which our direct program manager was not meeting the expectations, leading to negative impacts on overall team dynamics and delivery.

### When did you observed that / timeframe
During the ten months that I worked with him, I have noticed that there are many areas where he could improve his skills in leading and managing the product security SDLC team more effectively.

## What is observed and why you think he is underperforming?

I observed a repetetive patterns since 6 months where he consistent absence in team meetings (standup, sprint planning, retro)

the PM is frequently absent from meetings, fails to deliver project requirements on time, and demonstrates a lack of commitment to the project. This underperformance is causing delays, miscommunication, and hindering the progress of the engineering team.

That time,joined the team, when our previous manager was fired due to micromanagemnt issue.

```
During the ten months that I have worked with Mohamed, I have noticed that there are many areas where he could improve his skills in leading and managing the prodsec-SDLC team more effectively.

1. Consistent absence in team meetings

Team often needs to meet up to discuss blockers and other pressing issues. Engagement from the manager in these meetings can help the manager to know the challenges the team is facing and represent the team better. Mohamed's consistent absence in these meetings (weekly standup, sprint planning, retro etc) is causing the team to get disconnected from their leader.


2. Lack of management skillset

Action items from various meetings, like retrospective meetings, sometimes get ignored or forgotten as these are not effectively managed and tracked. While some engineers have stepped forward towards bridging this gap, Mohamed, in his current role as a manager, maybe the best person to ensure such issues get their due attention. This will benefit the team in becoming progressively more effective.

3. Unresponsiveness

- Our team is often called on to provide consultation on technical as well as process related topics. On several occasions, Mohamed remains unresponsive, which may cause the team's bad reputation.
e.g. : Engineering team is waiting for his input on FIPS validation and container scanning => https://splunk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PROD/pages/1078219837402/Product+Security+RACI

- For most of the working hours, Mohamed's slack status is set to "in-active" / "offline". His unresponsivenessnoften delays decisions as questions asked to him over slack remain unanswered. For example, ACS escalation, as the team is waiting for his input on a release blocker for 2 weeks.

4. Lack of Consistency with 1:1s:

- I have observed that most of my 1:1s have been canceled at the last minute or often without explanations. While it feels disrespectful as this happens regularly, my work also gets impacted as I cannot discuss critical issues that need a better conversation handled over the phone/video/in-person vs. over email.


5. Lack of transparency and adequate feedback : 

- My discussions with Mohamed regarding my career progression have always invoked some vague comments on how to improve further. Neither he justified my accomplishments to the upper leadership nor provided me with a structural path of expectations toward the next role. I observed this consistent pattern for the past two promotion cycles.

- While I am still awaiting promotion to the next level and have been asked to provide my achievements to prepare for the promotion, I do not know what is holding me back and/or what is required from my end. 


=================

Describe the 2-3 strengths that contribute to their success in their role. Please include specific and relevant examples.

1. Have not observed any micro-management so far.
2. Have good friendly attitude.


==================

What are their biggest opportunities to improve that you think could make a real difference?

1. Responsiveness and availability during office hours.

2. Tracking and managing various ProdSec tasks to ensure things don't fall through the cracks. 

3. Work load distribution: In order to distribute the workload effectively among team members, it is important to become familiar with Splunk products, their sizing, and complexity.

4. Structured 1-1 meetings to provide constructive feedback and effective career guidance.
